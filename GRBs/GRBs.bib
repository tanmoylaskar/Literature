abstract = {The Extended Groth Strip (EGS) is one of the premier fields for extragalactic deep surveys. Deep observations of the EGS with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope cover an area of 0.38 square degrees to a 50\% completeness limit of 1.5 uJy at 3.6 um. The catalog comprises 57434 objects detected at 3.6 um, with 84\%, 28\%, and 24\% also detected at 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 um. Number counts are consistent with results from other Spitzer surveys. Color distributions show that the EGS IRAC sources comprise a mixture of populations: low-redshift star-forming galaxies, quiescent galaxies dominated by stellar emission at a range of redshifts, and high redshift galaxies and AGN.},

abstract = {The origin of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) has been enigmatic since their discovery. The situation improved dramatically in 1997, when the rapid availability of precise coordinates, for the bursts allowed the detection of faint optical and radio afterglows - optical spectra thus obtained have demonstrated conclusively that the bursts occur at cosmological distances. But, despite efforts by several groups, optical detection has not hitherto been achieved during the brief duration of a burst. Here we report the detection of bright optical emission from GRB990123 while the burst was still in progress. Our observations begin 22 seconds after the onset of the burst and show an increase in brightness by a factor of 14 during the first 25 seconds; the brightness then declines by a factor of 100, at which point (700 seconds after the burst onset) it falls below our detection threshold. The redshift of this burst, z \~{} 1.6 (refs 8, 9), implies a peak optical luminosity of 5× 1049ergs-1. Optical emission from $\gamma$-ray bursts has been generally thought to take place at the shock fronts generated by interaction of the primary energy source with the surrounding medium, where the $\gamma$-rays might also be produced. The lack of a significant change in the $\gamma$-ray light curve when the optical emission develops suggests that the $\gamma$-rays are not produced at the shock front, but closer to the site of the original explosion.},

abstract = {As part of the in-orbit checkout activities for the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) team carried out a deep observation (average integration time \~{}8 hr) of a field surrounding the bright QSO HS 1700+6416. This field contains several hundred z\~{}3 Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates, and we report here on their mid-infrared properties, including the IRAC detection rate, flux densities, and colors, and the results of fitting population synthesis models to the optical, near-infrared, and IRAC magnitudes. The results of the model fitting show that previous optical/near-infrared studies of LBGs were not missing large, hidden old stellar populations. The LBG candidates' properties are consistent with those of massive star-forming galaxies at z\~{}3. Other IRAC sources in the same field have similar properties, so IRAC selection may prove to be a promising method of finding additional high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {If high-redshift galaxies resemble rapidly star-forming galaxies in the local universe, most of the luminosity produced by their massive stars will have been absorbed by dust and reradiated as far-infrared photons that cannot be detected with existing facilities. This paper examines what can be learned about high-redshift star formation from the small fraction of high-redshift galaxies' luminosities that is emitted at accessible wavelengths. We first consider the most basic ingredient in the analysis of high-redshift surveys: the estimation of star formation rates for detected galaxies. Standard techniques require an estimate of the bolometric luminosity produced by their massive stars. We review and quantify empirical correlations between bolometric luminosities produced by star formation and the UV, mid-IR, sub-mm, and radio luminosities of galaxies in the local universe. These correlations suggest that observations of high-redshift galaxies at any of these wavelengths should constrain their star formation rates to within \~{}0.2-0.3 dex. We assemble the limited evidence that high-redshift galaxies obey these locally calibrated correlations. The second part of the paper assesses whether existing surveys have found the galaxies that host the majority of star formation at high redshift even though they directly detect only a small fraction of the luminosities of individual galaxies. We describe the characteristic luminosities and dust obscurations of galaxies at z\~{}0, z\~{}1, and z\~{}3. After discussing the relationship between the high-redshift populations selected in surveys at different wavelengths, we calculate the contribution to the 850 $\mu$m background from each and argue that these known galaxy populations can together have produced the entire observed background. The available data show that a correlation between star formation rate and dust obscuration Lbol,dust/LUV exists at low and high redshift alike. The existence of this correlation plays a central role in the major conclusion of this paper: most star formation at high redshift occurred in galaxies with moderate dust obscurations 1<\~{}Lbol,dust/LUV<\~{}100 similar to those that host the majority of star formation in the local universe and to those that are detected in UV-selected surveys.},
